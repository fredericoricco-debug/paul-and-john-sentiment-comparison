A Hard Day’s Night — Their First Movie,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story," Narrator: After having enjoyed all the success a recording group could ever hope for and finally achieve, the height of their success is still nowhere in sight. Their record sales to date have reached a figure beyond all comprehension. The next obvious step to further the Beatle image was a move from the world of wax to the world of celluloid, and the medium of motion pictures... Narrator: The initial announcement that The Beatles were going to make a motion picture aroused immediate and predictable enthusiasm from fans, but Beatle critics also welcomed the news, with a cynical hope that exposure on film would expose The Beatles as entertainment world freaks long on hair but short on talent. Beatle enemies also smirked in anticipation of the poison-pen treatment which they forecast would come from America's hard-nosed motion picture critics. Described officially as a low-budget film with little or no storyline, it was given all the publicity treatment of a major spectacular. Interviews were granted, The Beatles said they had fun, didn't act; John Lennon even admitted that they couldn't act! John Lennon: ""Well this is as good as anybody who makes a film that can't act, you know?"" (Laughter) Narrator: Newspaper and magazine critics held their pen at ready. Previews were held and so were breaths. Then—surprise—the most competent reviewers hailed The Beatles' first motion picture as a smash hit. They were compared to the Marx Brothers and encouraged to do it again. Amazed readers, pre-conditioned to knock the movie, now made plans to see it. In England, Beatle manager Brian Epstein casually looked up from a masterplan of a future Beatle tour to announce that the movie would break every existing motion picture box office record. The Beatles? As usual, they were just busy being Beatles... John Lennon: ""Ringo, John, Paul, George. Ringo, John, Paul, George..."" Paul McCartney: ""All together now!"" The Beatles: ""Ringo, John, Paul, George. Yay!"" Paul McCartney: ""By Jove, they've got it!"" Narrator: An estimated one hundred million Americans have already seen The Beatles on television or at their neighborhood theaters. Hundreds of thousands more have seen The Beatles in person. And that's just one country in a Beatle marketplace that knows no limits. This is only the beginning, for almost everything The Beatles now do sets a new entertainment record..."

: John Babcock with Al Wiman and Roger Christian of radio station KWFB, Hollywood, CA These are the sounds which complete the picture. For is there anybody in the civilized world who does not conjure up a mental motion picture of the performing Beatles at the first sound of their distinctive style? Which beatle? One immediately thinks of may vary. In Australia, it might be the mournful-faced Ringo. In Germany, it might be the baby-faced Paul McCartney. In Britain, It might be the literate Beatle leader John Lennon. In America, it might be the more quiet but whimsical George Harrison While others make no individual distinctions, they just see all four Beatles in motion, hair flopping, guitars waving, girls screaming. But everybody has a mental motion picture. And that picture, plus The Beatle sound, is the formula which when fed to the youth of the world brings on Beatlemania"
Beatles For Sale - Foreward,The Beatles,586,,,"This is the fourth by the four. 'Please, Please Me', 'With The Beatles', 'Hard Day's Night'. That's three. Now...'Beatles For Sale'. The young men themselves aren't for sale. Money, noisy though it is, doesn't talk that loud. But you can buy this album - you probably have, unless you're just browsing, in which case don't leave any dirty fingerprints on the sleeve! It isn't all currency or current though. There's priceless history between the covers. None of us is getting any younger. When, in a generation or so, a radio-active, cigar-smoking child, picnicking on Saturn, asks you what The Beatles affair was all about - ;Did you actually know them?'- don't try to explain all about the long hair and the screams! Just play the child a few tracks from this album and he'll probably understand what it is all about. The kids of AD 2000 will draw from this music much the sam sense of well being and warmth we do today. For the magic of The Beatles is, I suspect, timeless and ageless. It has broken all frontiers and barriers. It has cut through differences of race, age, and class. It is adored by the world. This album has some lovely samples of Beatles music. It has, for instance, eight new titles wrought by the incomparable John Lennon and Paul Mccartney, and mingling with the new, there are six numbers culled from the rhythmic wealth of the past extraordinary decade; pieces like Kansas City , and Rock and Roll Music . Marvelous. Many hours and hard day's nights of devoted industry went into the production of this album. It isn't a potboiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-christmas mixture. At least three of the Lennon-Mccartney songs were seriously considered as single releases until John popped up with I Feel Fine . These three were Eight Days A Week , No Reply and I'm A Loser . Each would have topped the charts, but as it is they are an adornment to this LP, and a lesson to other artists. As on other albums, The Beatles have tossed in far more value than the market usually demands. There are few gimmicks or recording tricks, though for effect, The Beatles and their recording manager George Martin have slipped in some novelties. Like Paul on Hammond organ to introduce drama into Mr. Moonlight , which also, and for the first time, has George Harrison applying a thump to an elderly African drum because Ringo was busy elsewhere in the studio, playing bongos. George's thump remains on the track. The bongos were later dropped. Ringo plays timpani in Every Little Thing , and on the Rock and Roll Music track George Martin joins John and Paul on one piano. On Words of Love , Ringo plays a packing case. Beyond this, it is a straightforward 1964 disc-making. Quite the best of it's kind in the world. There is little or nothing on the album that cannot be reproduced on stage, which is, as students and critics of pop-music know, not always the case. Here it is then. The best album yet-quite definitely, says John, Paul, George, and Ringo-full of everything which made the four the biggest attraction the world has ever known. Full of raw John and Melodic Paul; a number from George, and a bonus from Ringo. For those who like to know who does exactly what, there are details alongside each title."

Beatles Will Be Beatles,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story,"Narrator: It's a great sound, isn't it? Some say, it's the sound of a group that has achieved overnight success; but don't you believe it... Narrator: It took The Beatles over five years to become an overnight success. And, much like the title of their first motion picture, it was indeed a ""Hard Day's Night."" John Lennon—who almost was side-tracked into an art career, by the way—must be credited not only with initiating The Beatles, but also as the one member who never gave up hopе of success, despite many advеrsities. And he was always the rallying point for regroupings. John Lennon, whose whole family was musically inclined, was also the first to form a group and called it The Quarrymen. Paul McCartney soon joined John's Quarrymen, thereby earning the title of Beatle-in-waiting #2. Now, the world never caught onto a crazy called Quarrymen-mania, as evidence that the magic sound was not yet formed. The Quarrymen, originally five in number, dwindled down to John and Paul, but under the new name, The Nerk Twins, there was still disillusionment. With musical idols Buddy Holly and The Crickets, George Harrison was the next to join John and Paul, becoming Beatle-in-waiting #3. With George, the new group name became John and the Moondogs; but, no Moondog-mania. By now, the skiffle craze was dimming, and with it, the hopes of the Moondogs, who were still in their skiffle-apprenticeship at a time when skiffle journeymen couldn't find work. While still working on new ideas for sound, and some moral support too, from better known Liverpool groups, John Lennon introduced the name ""Beetle""— Narrator: But who came up with the final name, ""Beatles"" spelled with the B-E-A-T? Paul McCartney explains the origin... ""John got the name Beatles..."" (""In a vision, probably, you know"") ""...ages ago, you know, when we wanted, when we needed a name. And everybody  a name, and he thought of Beatles."" Interviewer: ""Why the B-E-A instead of the B-E-E?"" George: ""Well, actually, you know..."" John: ""Well, you know, if you  it would be double-E, it was hard enough getting people to understand why it was B-E-A, nevermind, you know..."" Narrator: For a time the name was softened to Silver Beetles and, with various other artists joining and leaving the group, John, Paul, and George were getting closer and closer to that magic door which, one day, was to suddenly fly open and lift them from a Liverpool cellar and carry them before a world spotlight so bright it would leave their image permanently embedded in entertainment history. The Beatles like to be thought of as a fun-loving, devil-may-care, non-conforming, live-loving quartet, which is more often disjointed than jointed. But, while they may have neither interest nor ability in booking their own engagements, or counting profits, they've consistently displayed that they take their music seriously, themselves lightly, and world acclaim moderately. Not even their success-swelled bank accounts seem to faze their basic down-to-earth outlook; even with full knowledge that critics and friends by the legion are scampering, clawing, begging for tidbits of information— any information—on how they formed, how they dress, they take it casually... Narrator: John Lennon, for instance, when asked the technical question of how long it took them to develop the Beatles' sound from its parent skiffle beat, answered: ""Oh, over a period of about six months, I think. Or was it a year?"" ""No, it was a bit longer, John, 'cause..."" ""You forget, you know... I know I met Paul first, and, he-he sort of joined this sort of group. And then George. And it gradually changed until it was just us three."" Narrator: But it really wasn't as easy as it sounds. Those last painful month before discovery were full of obstructions, and barriers, and disillusionment, and disappointments, but, if success seemed to elude The Beatles in their native Liverpool, several junkets to Hamburg, Germany worked well for both their pocketbooks and their spirit. Particularly their last trip, in which they achieved their first audience reaction, which was later to be called Beatlemania. The Germans were the first to feel Beatlemania. And this despite the fact that a good part of the Beatle act was spoofing everything from Nazis to Nietzsche, and Aryans to Agrarians. The barbs, with noted Liverpudlian wit, were burned into Hamburg audiences between numbers and during numbers. Returning home to Liverpool, however, was somewhat of a disappointment, for their Hamburg success story hadn't reached home. For the boys, #10 Matthew Street, the address of the popular Cavern Club, was as far away as #10 Downing. About this same time, another Liverpool act, Merseyside, was achieving notable success. A group called Rory Storm and the Texans. Music historians would later pay particular note to a mournful-faced little drummer with The Texans, known to friends as Richie, but to the public as Ringo Starr. It wouldn't be long before Ringo would be Beatle #4. Lady Luck would be Beatle #5 and with the brilliant guiding hand of Brian Epstein as their manager, The Beatles would soon lift off the Liverpool launch pad with enough force to put the entire music world into orbit..."

We still, you know, even if our film – this, A Hard Day’s Night – is the biggest box office attraction ever, you know, it still won’t make us feel as though we’re actors. But I think we’d all enjoy making a new film. RINGO: Yeah, it’s good fun. I think the next one we make will be more fun, because we’ve sort of got the hang of things. Like on this one, when we first started, when we’re not supposed to look at the camera, you’d always sort of find yourself turning ‘round and smiling at it.  You’d just smile as soon as you saw the camera, you know. PAUL: And on this one, I don’t know whether this happens on lots of films, we used to keep breaking up giggling. RINGO: Yeah. PAUL: We had some great giggling fits, you know. We’d sort of say a line, and I kept doing it a particular way. There was one line I kept saying to Ringo, it’s about the grandfather in the film who goes off to— RINGO: Well, we can’t tell you, ‘cause we’ll ruin the film, you see! PAUL: We can’t tell you  but it was just this one thing where the grandfather goes off to a club, and I was supposed to say to Ringo “It’s all your fault” and things. ‘Cause in the film actually, although it’s not true in real life, we sort of pick on Ringo a bit, you know, because it was obvious really, because he’s sort of smaller and it looks funny in the film. But I’m supposed to be picking on Ringo and saying “It’s all your fault” and things. And as I was saying it, I’m a bit – I kept flapping my arms up and down, I don’t know why, I must have thought I was a good actor!  And I was just sort of flapping around and saying, “It’s all your fault!”  Flapping my arms around, and he couldn’t stand it, he was giggling away. So then I started laughing, and we just collapsed, and we took so many takes on that bit. RINGO: Yeah, twelve takes on that bit. PAUL: Yeah. And I think we cut that bit in the end or something.  RINGO: Yeah. PAUL: They cut some of it.
RINGO: They cut half of it, yeah, but you know, a lot of laughs. All different things that happened were funny to us which, you know, they haven’t printed or put on the film, but it’s great when we go and see the film, then we can sort of say, “Remember that bit?” if they showed the one we did before, you know, where we all broke up."

George Harrison,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story," Narrator: That's the lead guitar artistry and Beatle-mania of George Harrison. Although it's not documented, George Harrison was probably born with an amused smile on his face, and if he has his way at the end, he'll go out in a similar manner—amused or an attempt to stifle a yawn. Harrison, whose deadpan expression makes the sphinx jealous, didn't join The Beatles until 1958, but if he were ever asked, ""Why?"" he'd probably say, ""Because nobody asked me."" In his teens, musical intеrests were cеntered on Buddy Holly, but sports interests dulled early attempts at a serious musical study. George is an interesting combination of beat and blasé, but takes his music seriously. To get an angry response out of George, you'd probably have to be his tailor, for clothing, next to music, is his only concern. As for a personal glimpse into Harrison, he is alternately analytical and casual... Narrator: George, you might say, is the unsung hero of the group. Although he doesn't do most of the songwriting or lead-singing, he's very proud of the job he does do. As for his specific role with the Beatle group, Harrison says: ""I play lead guitar and sing a couple of songs and I sing a couple of bits on songs that people don't think I sing on..."" Narrator: Blasé with a beat. That's pretty much the story on George Harrison. Guitar-playing and singing are not George's only interests. In his own words, ""I like parties and a bit of fun, like anyone else, but there's nothing better, for me, than a bit of peace and quiet, sitting around a big fire with your slippers on and watching the tele—that's the life."" George's idea of life is a far-cry from his real life. Like the rest of The Beatles, his home is often surrounded by dozens of female fans. ""They don't worry me, though,"" says George. ""In fact, I rather like it. I'd be dead worried if those girls weren't around and if their screams died away... In any case, we aren't home very much these days."" George did have one chance to go home over the past year. It was during a two-week vacation recently; the first the group has taken since their phenomenal rise to stardom. Instead, he took off for America ""to see the ordinary side of The States,"" he said, ""the shops, the airports, the trains, the garages, and the way people seem to live in general."" Despite the novel hair-do and the new approach The Beatles have to music, George feels that the main reason for the phenomenal rise of the group is because, in his words, ""We're a different generation, and so are our fans."" Born in Liverpool, George left school to become an apprentice electrician. He said he stopped trying to become an electrician though because... he kept blowing everything up! Narrator: But how successful did Harrison feel the group would be when he first joined? When asked if he ever thought that he and the members of the group would ever be as big as they are today, Harrison, in down-to-earth fashion said: ""Well, I'm still only 5-foot-11 you know..."" Narrator: George Harrison is the youngest of The Beatles, born February 25th, 1943, and he's the one with the longest hair. ""As for my starting the haircut, that was completely by accident,"" says George. ""We'd been swimming. When I came from the pool, my hair dried into what is now the Beatle hair-do. Not having a comb or brush, I did not comb it afterwards, and then it looked as it does now. We decided we liked it and it has remained."" George's thoughts are closely allied to those of his fellow Beatles. He doesn't think much about the future. In his own words, ""We're too busy today to talk about tomorrow."" And he's disinterested in many other things that older people consider worthwhile. He's completely at ease and looks at the prospects of the group quite realistically... Narrator: True to his unhurried approach to life, Harrison is candid about the early aims of The Beatles, measured against that which has happened since. ""We didn't sit down and think, 'We're gonna be stars and gonna have funny haircuts.' The only thing we wanted to do is make a record."" Narrator: And make-a-record they did. And since, in every field of their endeavor in entertainment, broken all existing records..."

Historical Notes,The Beatles,586,,,"The group's ninth album in the UK was called simply The Beatles but quickly became better known as 'The White Album'. The double-LP was issued on the fifth anniversary of the release of their second album With The Beatles - 22nd November, 1968. The Beatles released 34 new tracks in 1968 - returning to the high level of productivity they had maintained from 1963 to 1965. The first music of the year came in March with the arrival of their seventeenth single 'Lady Madonna'. Soon after it was recorded, the Beatles flew to Rishikesh, India for several weeks of mediation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and they enjoyed a prolific period of song writing at this remote location. They began recording these new songs at Abbey Road on 30th May and studio work occupied most of their time until the final session on 16th October. Two songs from this period were released as a single on 30th August, 1968 - 'Hey Jude' and 'Revolution'. It was the first Beatles record to be pressed with the Apple label and the Parlophone imprint was also replaced for the two LP discs comprising The Beatles . Any expectations of a cover to rival the vivid art work of Sgt. Pepper of Magical Mystery tour were immediately overturned. The outside of the sleeve was completely white was the only lettering consisting of 'The Beatles' embossed on the front and also printed on the spine with the catalogue number. Early copies also had an individual number stamped on the front. However, in contrast to the minimalistic look, some generous inserts were slipped alongside the records. There were four glossy color photographs of the individual Beatles and a large fold out poster displaying a photo collage on one side and lyrics on the other. Despite being an expensive double album, The Beatles was a huge seller. It entered the UK chart at number one and remained there for a total of eight of the 22 weeks it was listed. In the USA, it topped the charts of nine weeks and stayed in the album chart for an initial run of 65 weeks. As with Sgt. Pepper , no singles were released from 'The White Album' in the UK and USA during the sixties. Amid the sessions for The Beatles , the animated film Yellow Submarine was given it's UK premier on 17th July. The soundtrack LP featured four new Beatles songs and was in the shops eight weeks after the release of The Beatles ."

John Lennon,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story,"Narrator: From the rough and rowdy streets of Hamburg, to the cellars of Liverpool's ancient and not-so-honourable alleys, The Beatles were already legend. And, like musical boulders dropped into still water, the story of that strange, over-powering audience reaction rippled across the continent. Perhaps Roger Christian can explain a few reasons for this Beatlemania... Roger Christian: One reason is John Lennon, the chief-Beatle. Without John, there would be no Beatles. John was the one who organized the group and gave them their name. One that has become in the past year, the most important word in the English vocabulary. On October 9th, 1940, John Winston Lennon was born in Liverpool. He grew to be 5'11"" tall with brown hair and brown eyes. John Lennon is a determined 23-year-old whose somewhat stern face gives the impression of an angry young man. Fittingly, Lennon is called the chief-Beatle, ""But we don't let it count for much, really,"" he says. ""If we've got to have a leader, I'm him."" The appointment of John as group leader came about not from necessity, but only to fulfill a public demand. ""People kept coming up and asking who the leader of the group was."" The Beatles replied, ""Nobody!"" The people said, ""Well, there must be a boss."" So the others said to me, ""Well, you started the whole thing off, John, so, you've got to be our leader."" And that's the way it was. John goes on to say: ""Ours is a cooperative group. Nobody lays down any laws. We talk things over. We have our rows, nothing serious though. Just differences like any other human being."" And, like his three fellow Beatles, Lennon is an individual who doesn't hesitate at any time to speak his mind. Once, when asked about politics, he replied, ""Politics? They have no message for me, nor for any of our group. The bomb, nuclear disarmament, well, like everyone else,  I don't want to end up a festering heap; but I don't stay up nights worrying, I'm preoccupied with life, not death."" Born in Liverpool, John attended Liverpool High School and later the Liverpool College of Art. Lennon readily admits his school life was far from being successful. He goes on to say, ""My whole school life was a case of I couldn't care less. It was just a joke as far as I was concerned. But don't think I'm proud of it. I wouldn't want anyone to follow my example."" Al Wiman, in our Beatle biography in sound,  probes deeper into John Lennon's fascinating mind... Al Wiman: Although two of the three ""R""s of school held no particular fascination for John Lennon, he always had a desire to express himself with the medium of the third ""R""—writing. His originality of style is evident in his book, published by Simon & Schuster. The book, aptly-titled 'In His Own Write,' is a huge sales success. When John was asked if he employed the help of a ghostwriter, he jocularly replied: ""No, I mean—who's going to help you with a thing like that?"" As for the offbeat style John employed within its pages, he candidly says: ""Well, that's the way I think."" The huge success of his book amply overshadows his self-admitted failures in school, but even before his literary achievements, John was to taste success in a Liverpool club called The Cavern"

Liverpool And All The World!,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story,": John Babcock with Al Wiman and Roger Christian of radio station KWFB, Hollywood, CA Liverpool, a poor but proud British seaport which took more pride in her history than hope for her future, has lifted her head. Instead of the somber rattle of poverty echoing faintly from her old cobble-stoned streets, sounds which mixed with the fading ship’s horns, and pulsating organ-like police sirens, there's now a sound of hope. It started less than a decade ago in the cellars of Liverpool’s beat generation dives. It was thе sound of a new music. And it lifted the spirits and hopе of a whole city while entertaining the world. The Beatles, of course, are the best known of the Liverpool musical groups. And none of The Beatles get to spend as much time in their Liverpool homes as they would wish, but wherever The Beatles are, Liverpool is with them in spirit. And it works the other way around too This is the biography of Beatlemania!"

Man Behind The Beatles — Brian Epstein,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story,"This is the reason why Beatlemania was ready to serve to the world; into the musical Liverpool cauldron, where the basic Beatle ingredients of excitement, sound, movement, freshness—cooked over the bubbling waters of the Mersey river—it was Brian Epstein stirring the brew, adding from time to time the dash of professional seasoning. Drawing on his own theatrical education, Epstein, the Beatle manager, was able to take the admittedly scruffy quartet, and act as both an objective mirror and business guide. How Epstein and The Beatles joined forces is another chapter in this living legend. Epstein, at the youthful age of 27, had rejected the temptations of a career in theater to enter the family business in Liverpool. Despite an almost life-long yearning for theater and a formal education which included study at the royal academy of dramatic art in London, he decided to employ his creative talents and boundless energy in the business world, where the chances of financial security were considerably greater than theater. Although his personal tastes were somewhat sophisticated, Brian Epstein found the business of selling pop music records so financially rewarding that he decided he'd better immerse himself in the pop music world; which, strangely enough, was focusing its beams on Liverpool, and the Mersey Beat, successor to both the European skiffle and American rock, were popular. So down the cobblestone streets of Liverpool's storied beat generation section went Epstein, with dress and manner genteel. He reportedly projected a feeling of confusion the first time he was confronted by The Beatles. But on subsequent trips, his demeanor changed. And when Brian Epstein finally made a personal decision to manage The Beatles, it was a decision which would affect the musical history of the world..."
Man Behind The Music — George Martin,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story," Narrator: That's the sound that's rocked the music world, and, in that world, music or jukeboxes which are equipped to accept coins in return for recorded Beatle entertainment, feel the metallic waterfall of dimes, quarters, shillings, marks, pesos, francs, lyra, yen, and other forms of national coin. And from the back of burro-driven ox-carts in remote sections of Latin America, to plush, air-conditioned, ultra-modern record emporiums of the continent, eager hands reach for each new Beatle record. Worldwide record sales reportedly have already exceeded the 30-million mark. Why? Why, indeed. Certainly a key factor is Beatle manager Brian Epstein, who found the long-haired version of Aladdin's lamp in a Liverpool cellar. But there's still one more man who's played a key role in this amazing Beatles story. He certainly doesn't look like a genie. But, on the other hand, he doesn't necessarily look like an oboe player who once conducted classical music, either. But he was just that. His name: George Martin. He selects the music; the material. And the success of The Beatles is a commentary on George Martin's ability. While the formula for Beatlemania was being sampled on the continent, America's first exposure to The Beatles came in short bursts from small record companies unable to marshal the promotional kickoff needed to properly introduce the young singers to America. That's when Capitol Records decided to take over distribution and planned a full-scale, coast-to-coast masterplan, and The Beatles then had the winning combination to meet America..."

Paul McCartney,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story," Narrator: James Paul McCartney—the baby-faced Beatle—an extremely handsome fellow, born the 18th of June, 1942. The 5' 11"" McCartney has hazel eyes. Paul's home is an atypically suburban area of Liverpool: Allerton, where his father still works as a cotton salesman. His mother died when he was only 14 years of age. He often is heard to say, ""She would have been so proud to see our success, had she lived."" He describеs his early years as awkward, doing evеrything in reverse, and he was apparently very self-conscious of the fact that he has always been left-handed. McCartney, along with Lennon, writes all of the songs for the group, and together they have turned out over 100 songs Narrator: And of these more than one hundred tunes, many have become hits and all have been recorded in hit albums. When asked about the acclaim accorded the group, through the number of their records which have been sold, Paul said: ""No idea. George said the other day—George Harrison, that is—said it was about 30 million a year, or something, which is fantastic."" With this in mind, John, the other member of the songwriting team, candidly admits: ""We make more money out of writing songs than we do out of appearing and running around waving and that, you know..."" Narrator: The sudden rise to fame by The Beatles is one of the things that Paul has thought a great deal about. ""You know,"" he said, ""we were talking about this just the other day. When you're about eleven, you start to think about what's going to happen to you. I've often thought about it. My plan was to go on playing the clubs until I reached about 25—a ripe old age—and then go to John's art college and hang on there for a couple of years. I never dreamt about being discovered or anything like that. I always thought discovery was something you read about."" At present, McCartney and The Beatles are being read about and studied. Paul realizes this, but he can't answer why..."

Recording Notes,The Beatles,586,,,"To complete the many songs needed for their double-LP, The Beatles recorded regularly during twenty weeks from 30th May to 16th October 1968. The final studio date was a 24-hour marathon session to create the running order for the four sides of the album and the edits and cross-fades between the songs. The sessions mark an important turning point in their recording career because it was during this period that The Beatles first recorded on an eight-track tape machine. Since 1964, the group had used four-track for all their album albums by but 1966, they found their musical arrangements usually required more tracks than were available. The solution was the create extra ones by copying the first four tracks to a second blank tape and simultaneously mixing some of them together to leave free as many racks as were needed for addition overdubs. 'Bouncing Down' was a time consuming process because the tracks that were being mixed together would form part of the final sound balance of the completed song so it was important to be satisfied with the mix before overdubbing commenced. With eight tracks now available, the problem was eliminated - until even more were needed. Work began on the album using four tracks and, while some songs could be confined to these, most had to be 'bounced down' to a second, third, or even - as with 'Revolution 1' and 'Ob-LA-Di, Ob-La-Da' - a fourth tape. The Beatles' first experience of using an eight track recording at Abbey Road was during a session on 3rd September for 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. As it had been started  on four-track. the master was transferred to an eight-track machine to allow further overdubbing. However, 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' was re-recorded on eight-track from scratch two days later with a guest appearance by Eric Clapton. and completed on 6th September with several overdubs. George's decision to ask a friend to play on his song was a significant one. Although The Beatles had previously used other musicians on their sessions, they had been from other areas of music such as classical, jazz or Indian music. For the first time, here was a star musician performing on an instrument already featured in the group. The album's long sessions would often begin in the afternoon and continue until daybreak the next morning. There were also occastions when two songs were recorded at the same time in separate studios. In July, engineer Geoff Emerick left the sessions and did not work with the group again until nearly a year later the Abbey Road . Ken Scott, who has first sat at the mixing desk for some of the Magical Mystery Tour songs, recored and mixed two thirds of 'The White Album'. For one week, George Matin relinquished his seat in the room so that he could take a holiday and, consequently, his 21-year old production assistant Chris Thomas supervised sessions."

Ringo Starr,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story,": Boys, by Luther Dixon and Wes Farrell, as sung by the Beatles I been told when a boy kiss a girl He takes a trip around the world Hey, hey, (bop shoo wa 'n' bop bop shoo wa) Hey, hey, (bop shoo wa 'n' bop bop shoo wa) Hey, hey, (bop shoo wa 'n' bop shoo wa) Yeah, she say you do.

(bop shoo wa) Well, I talk about boys, (yeah, yeah, boys) Don't you know I mean boys? (yeah, yeah, boys) Well, i talk about boys now, (yeah, yeah, boys) Ah, boys… --------- : John Babcock with Al Wiman and Roger Christian of radio station KWFB, Hollywood, CA The song is called 'boys'. The boy singing is called Ringo. He's called Ringo because of his passion for wearing lots of rings. Ringo is the most recent addition to the group and he's also the oldest member. Ringo’s friends call him Richie, a name he picked up in Dingle, one of the toughest areas of Liverpool. Often compared to New York's storied ""Hell's Kitchen"", the cobble streets and ancient buildings which surrounded his terraced home didn't hide the bomb craters which were left there in 1940, the year of Ringo’s birth. Richie went to St. Silas school in Dingle but dropped out at the age of six because of appendicitis. He had complications which resulted in hospitalization for a year. Recovering, he went back and started all over again. But at the age of thirteen, a cold got away from him and he developed pleurisy while on a trip to London. Rushed back to his Liverpool home, he spent another year in hospital. That ended schooling and Ringo went to work in an engineering company. In 1959, around Christmas time, Ringo got his first drum kit. He was eighteen at the time
Ringo, the smallest member of the group, standing five feet eight inches tall, joined John, Paul, and George in the predawn era of Beatlemania, complete with beard. The beard was shaven, his sideburns saved. And the transformation began. Rule number one, forget the haircuts. And this he did. In fact, so successfully that some observers began to believe that his brown-haired locks were longer than those of George. ""No, George's is longer than mine. Yeah, mine's a scruffy mess."" Although Ringo has been involved in The Beatle mad movement for over a year, he's still amazed at the impact the group has made. In Ringo’s words, ""None of us have quite grasped what it's all about yet. It's washing over our heads like some huge tidal wave. But we're young and youth is on our side. And it's youth that matters right now. I don't care about politics or anything. Just people. And the people certainly seems to care about The Beatles."" As Ringo puts it, ""We're international figures. Everyone wants to investigate us and get inside us and try to understand what makes a Beatle tick They sent big writers down to talk to us. Writers who say they want to talk to us about our sociological significance. In Birmingham, there were dozens of policemen controlling screaming fans at the studio doors while we rehearsed a television program."" ""Well,"" Ringo says, ""If they didn't scream, I guess we wouldn't be where we are today. But don't ask me to explain it."" For Ringo is not one for explanation, or for that matter talking either. You see, Ringo is the quiet one. He sits at his drums like some Buddhist idol and wears a worried frown more often than a smile. Once in a while, he lets a smile shatter his melancholy saying, ""I'm not really miserable. It's just me face."" Ringo considers his initiation into the group as the greatest single event of his life. To him, the taste of success means that his mother doesn't have to work anymore. He takes great pleasure in providing those things for his mother which increase her happiness Beatle manager Brian Epstein considers Ringo a tremendous blossoming talent. And goes a step further to say, "" I think he will prove to have great acting ability, probably the greatest of the four. ""Ringo sometimes refers to himself as the odd-ball Beatle, perhaps because of the fact that fate dubbed him with the distinction of being the ingredient which completed the quartet. When asked how he feels with the label of the “different” member of the group, his dry sense of humor bubbled in this reply, ""Well, I, I've, you know, I've always been a drummer and I'm, I've always sat at the back so I enjoy it at the back. When they start throwing things it's a good place to be."" Although he likes to sing, he prefers to please his fans by playing his drums and leaving the vocal work to the other three members of the group. When asked if he would like to take the spotlight to sing more often, he modestly replied, ""Uh, no I think when we do a show one of them's enough for me. And it's more fun for the kids if three of them are singing at once than just me."" ""It isn't the screaming fans or the things they throw that affect me. That's normal. You get used to it. I love 'em and it's great to know they love you. It's a feeling that I might let them down."" The feelings of Ringo Starr Well, Ringo’s worries in this department are completely unfounded because his fan mail often numbers the greatest. But all the fan mail and adulation heaped upon Ringo hasn't changed his attitude at all. He shares the same likes and dislikes of his fellow Beatles. As Ringo would put it, ""I'm not interested in living it up. All the money's invested. I don't even know how much it is. I don't take out very much, just for clothes and a few cigarettes. When it ends, ""Well"", Ringo says, ""I've been skinned before. But I’d like to have enough to do something. Well, something with me hands. I've always loved basket work or pottery, shaping something, making something, being able to say I did that."" Right now, Ringo, along with the rest of the Beatles, is making something: musical history"

Sneaky Haircuts And More About Paul,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story,": (John Babcock, in association with Al Wiman and Roger Christian of radio station KWFB, Hollywood, CA) One critic tried to explain their success by saying they have a sound which is today's version of the eternal cry of the youth. Still other critics place a lesser value of their musical appeal and attribute their success to their physical appearance. The group's most distinguishing characteristic: the haircut. A cardinal rule, never show the forehead. I asked Paul if the group ever visits the barber shop. “You know, you notice when you've had a haircut. But you don't notice when we have. Well, you know, it's sneaky -- haircuts. ""Ah, those sneaky haircuts Those who would analyze the reasons for the fantastic appeal on The Beatles often say it's their sound, their accent and so forth, still everyone agrees that The Beatles are successful. And of success, Paul McCartney says, ""It's fabulous, the success and all that, but I wish people wouldn't think that because we're successful that we're unapproachable. It is not true. ""It really bothers Paul that some people think he has changed since The Beatles became the rage of England. ""I really can't quite explain it but when I meet some of my old mates, they don't seem to be the same. They have a different attitude toward me. Perhaps they think that we've all gone big time since getting into the charts. I really don't know. But I know they're wrong The Beatles have been exposed to hecklers despite their popularity. In some cities The Beatles have been met with a few jeers, but they shrug it off philosophically as part of the game of showbusiness. On at least one occasion, however, the jeering got out of hand and three delinquents, or 'teddy boys' as The Beatles would call them, hurled objects at the stage. On this subject all spoke for one and one Beatle spoke for all when it came to reaction. ""It was just a minor group that threw them, you know. And we had four of them in the room in Melbourne. And they, they decided at the end it was a stupid trick. We brought them up and said, “Well, why did you do it?” and they said, 'Well, every time we turn the radio on your records are on,' so what can you say to that?"" Many a successful group of the past has fallen victim to what has become the established rule rather than the exception. Splitting up to individually pursue careers. I asked Paul if his group, The Beatles was really a compatible combination. ""Well, we've been each other's friends for years now, a long time. And you know, I knew George and John at school. And so, we're just -- we are each other's friends, so we get along. We get along as well as best friends do which is lucky."" Is it luck, talent, timing, the breaks? I think it's a combination of all these things. And many, many more factors. But they all add up to spell success and this very tangible commodity can often change one in the limelight. But I doubt very much whether it will change Paul McCartney. He still holds the same ideals high, still likes the same things that he did when he was a boy. He's still very fond of art. In Paul’s words, ""I got my diploma in art and I’m still very interested in this subject. I often sketch while we're on tour, that is when I’m not writing songs or go go-carting."" And he hopes someday to earn enough, enough money that is, so he can invest in a business, his brother's business.

The Beatles’ Christmas Record,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1963, 'month': 12, 'day': 6}",The Beatles’ Christmas Album," Hoo!  Good King Wenceslas looked out On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!) As the slow ray round about Deep and crisp and crispy Brightly show the boot last night On the mosty cruel Henry Hall and David Lloyd Betty Grable too  Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show  (whistling)  This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because ""Love Me Do"" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime: Garry Crimble to you Garry Mimble to you Getty Bable, dear Christmas Happy Birthday me too  This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing  Yes! Yes! Oh yes!
 Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...  Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!  ...to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...  Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!  ...so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription  Ja, das wird uns danke schon Und denn gruss von even Ja, denn gruss von even schon Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy Danke schon Ja, Ringo! Hello, Ringo here As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups... (Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas) Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted (Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas) King Wenceslas:
Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!) On the feast of Stephen (Hey!) When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!) Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!) Hooray! Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!) I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters And I'd just like to say: Brightly was the shone that night Though the winter cruel When a pork pie came inside Gathering winter cruel Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!) Had a very shiny nose (A shiny nose!) When ev'rybody picked it... Ha, ha, ha, ha... Oh yeah! Oh! Rudolph, the red nosed Ringo (Rudolph!) Had a very shiny nose

The Beatles Look At Life,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story,": John Babcock, with Al Wiman and Roger Christian of radio station KWFB, Hollywood, CA There never has been a group like The Beatles who could entertain and so completely captivate their audience. But The Beatles think of themselves only as entertainers. John Babcock offers this explanation: “Being non-conformists in the areas such as dress and hair style doesn't imply any desire to be a style setter. In fact, thе opposite is the case. Bеatle styles are for John, Paul, George and Ringo, not every Tom, Dick and Harry.” In using the same basic philosophy, The Beatles don't want to be called upon to make any sociological judgements, foreign policy statements, or take public stands on any non-show business subject. They are firm believers that everybody's responsible for himself and in their own cases feel that that's a full-time job. Specifically, John Lennon pegged The Beatles’ feelings when asked about what responsibility he felt realizing that many youngsters mimic all Beatle behavior. ""Well, we just behave as normally as we can, you know. We don't feel as though we should preach this and tell them that, you know. Let them do what they like."""

“Victims” Of Beatlemania,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story,": John Babcock with Al Wiman and Roger Christian of radio station KWFB, Hollywood, CA If the off-stage Beatles feel somewhat impersonal toward the public, the public never seems impersonal when it comes to The Beatles: People either like The Beatles or dislike The Beatles. But indifference is almost never discovered. For those who like The Beatles, the feelings may run to high emotion such as a victim of Beatlemania, or perhaps a more subdued but loyal response such as this: ""They give the change of something in the way of non-conformity and i think every teenager well, that's what they look for, especially in this day and age. They stress non-conformity and that's what The Beatles are."" Of course, there are sometimes distraught fathers who shake their heads in confused disbelief after watching their daughters wilt under the emotional strain of idol worship. ""Ah, it's a mob, you know. They're just part of the mob. I mean, uh, they're monkey-see, monkey-do it, so they come running. That's all. It's like a bunch of monkeys, you know."" And let's not forget some of the adult mothers who accompany youngsters to airport fan club rallies. ""You look like a housewife. Are you here to see The Beatles?"" ""Oh, you must be kidding. My husband's coming. And otherwise, do you think I’d fight this motley crew?"" But whether you're a fan or a critic, Beatlemania is a reality. And as Longfellow once advised, ""For after all, the best thing one can do when it's raining, is to let it rain."""

Who’s A Millionaire?,The Beatles,586,"{'year': 1964, 'month': 11, 'day': 23}",The Beatles’ Story,"Narrator: But what if there had been no Cavern Club? No Brian Epstein? No George Martin? No Capitol Records? No Lady Luck, to smile down on those four lads from Liverpool? George Harrison very simply puts it this way: ""I dunno. I know if we weren't, uh, making a lot of money and, uh, popular, then we'd just be poor, unpopular Beatles."" Narrator: After many successful months of playing at The Cavern, The Beatles landed a booking tour with a Larry Parnes' Pop Show. The job wasn't a very good one, just backing a young singer, but it was the first time that The Beatles had played outside of thеir native Liverpool. After that camе their booking at the Indra Club in Hamburg, Germany, and a short time later, their discovery by Brian Epstein. While in Germany, the other Beatles—at that time including the late Stuart Sutcliffe—Paul McCartney, who had been with John since the days of the not-too-successful ""Nerk Twins,"" and George, who had just become a Beatle, all found the young German fräuleins much to their liking. But it was clear that John, although greatly elated over the group's newfound fame, longed for his home in Liverpool, and, in his words: ""My love was in Liverpool. She and I met one day and suddenly fell in love. Later, we were married, and I love her."" And like every good husband, John wanted his family to have financial security, however, at this point, it seems to be the least of his worries. When asked about the rumor if he, or any of the group, was a millionaire, he casually scoffed: ""No! That's another lousy rumor... "" (laughter) ""Is Brian Epstein not a millionaire?"" ""No, even he's not one, unfortunately..."" ""Where does all the money go?"" ""Well, a lot of it goes to Her Majesty..."" (laughter) ""She's a millionaire!"" (laughter) Narrator: And, she too, is a Beatle fan. And, as long as we have Beatle fans, I guess we'll always have Beatlemania..."
