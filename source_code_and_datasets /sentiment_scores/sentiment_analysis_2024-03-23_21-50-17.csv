Why so blue?  Sometimes, when eyes meet, you know They have to meet again Sometimes birds of a feather Got to fly together
 From a dingy attic window candles shine On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine Now they drink the highly recommended wine Free at last and feeling fine  I'm so glad, my fine young friend Glad for you I'm so glad, my fine young friend Glad for you  You used to be so blue, you used to be so blue Why so blue?",negative,-0.5213703969493508
