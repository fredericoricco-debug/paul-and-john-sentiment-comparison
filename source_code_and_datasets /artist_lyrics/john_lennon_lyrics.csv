A Spaniard in the Works,John Lennon,16450,,A Spaniard in the Works,"Jesus El Pifco was a foreigner and he knew it. He had imigrateful from his little white slum in Barcelover a good thirsty year ago having first secured the handy job as coachman in Scotland. The job was with the Laird of McAnus, a canny old tin whom have a castle in the Highlads. The first thing Jesus EI Pifco noticed in early the days was that the Laird didn't seem to have a coach of any discription or even a coach house you know, much to his dismable. But - and I use the word lightly - the Laird did seem to having some horses, each one sporting a fine pair of legs. Jesus fell in love with them at first sight, as they did with him, which was lucky, because his quarters were in the actually stables along side his noble four lepered friends. Pretty polly one could see Jesus almost every day, grooming his masters horses, brushing their manebits and hammering their teeth, whistling a quaint Spanish refrain dreaming of his loved wombs back home in their little white fascist bastard huts. 'A well pair of groomed horses I must say,' he would remark to wee Spastic Sporran the flighty chamberlain, whom he'd had his good eye on eversince Hogmanose. 'Nae sa bad' she would answer in her sliced Aberdeen-martin accent. 'Ye spend more time wi' yon horses than ye do wi' me,' with that she would storm back to her duties, carefully tying her chastity negro hardly to her skim. Being a good catholic, Jesus wiped the spit from his face and turned the other cheese - but she had gone leaving him once small in an agatha of christy. 'One dave she woll go too farther, and I woll leaf her' he said to his fave rave horse. Of course the horse didn't answer, because as you know they cannot speak, least of all to a garlic eating, stinking, little yellow greasy fascist bastard catholic Spaniard. They soon made it up howevans and Jesus and wee Spastic were once morphia unitely in a love that knew no suzie. The only thing that puzzled Jesus was why his sugarboot got so annoyed when he called her his little Spastic in public. Little wonder howeapon, with her real name being Patrick, you see? 'Ye musna' call me Spastic whilst ma friends are here Jesus ma bonnie wee dwarf' she said irragated. 'But I cannot not say Patrick me little tartan bag' he replied all herb and angie inside. She looked down at him through a mass of naturally curly warts. 'But Spastic means a kind of cripple in English ma sweet wee Jesus, and ai'm no cripple as you well known! ' 'That's true enough' said he 'but I didn't not realize being a foreigner and that, and also not knowing your countries culture and so force, and anywait I can spot a cripple anywhere.' He rambled on as Patrick knelt down lovingly with tears in her eye and slowly bit a piece of his bum. Then lifting her face upwarts, she said with a voice full of emulsion 'Can ye heffer forgive me Jesus, can ye? ' she slobbed. He looked at her strangely as if she were a strangely, then taking her slowly right foot he cried; 'Parreesy el pino a strevaro qui bueno el franco senatro! ' which rugby transplanted means - 'Only if you've got green braces' - and fortunately she had. They were married in the fallout, with the Lairds blessing of course, he also gave them a 'wee gifty' as he put it, which was a useful addition to their bottom lawyer. It was a special jar of secret ointment made by generators of his forefingers to help get rid of Patricks crabs which she had unluckily caught from the Laird of McAnus himself at his late wifes (Lady McAnus') wake.
They were overjoyced, and grapenut abun and beyond the call of duty. 'The only little crawlie things we want are babies,' quipped Jesus who was a sport. 'That's right sweety' answered Patrick reaching for him with a knowsley hall. 'Guid luck to you and yours' shouted the Laird from the old wing. 'God bless you sir' said Jesus quickly harnessing his wife with a dexterity that only practice can perfect. 'Come on me beauty' he whispered as he rode his wife at a steady trot towards the East Gate. 'We mustn't miss the first race my dear.' 'Not likely' snorted his newly wed wife breaking into a gullup. 'Not likely' she repeated. The honeymood was don short by a telephant from Mrs El Pifco (his mother) who was apparently leaving Barcelunder to se her eldest sod febore she died laughing, and besides the air would do her good she added. Patrick looked up from her nosebag and giggled. 'Don't joke about Mamma please if you donlang, she are all I have loft in the world and besides your mother's a bit of a brockwurst herselves' said Jesus, 'And if she's still alive when she gets here we can throw up a party for her and then she can meet all our ugly Scottish friends' he reflected. 'On the other handle we can always use her as a scarecrab in the top field' said Patrick practically. So they packed their suitcrates marked 'his and hearse' and set off for their employers highly home in the highlies. 'We're home Sir' said Jesus to the wizened tartan figure knelt crouching over a bag of sheep. 'Why are ye bask so soon?' inquired the Laird, immediately recognizing his own staff through years of experience. 'I've had some bad jews from my Mammy - she's coming to seagull me, if its all ripe with you sir.' The Laird thought for a mumble, then his face lit up like a boiling wart. 'You're all fired' he smiled and went off whistling."

Henry and Harry,John Lennon,16450,,In His Own Write,"Henry was his father's son and it were time for him to leave school and go into father's business of Brummer Striving. It wert a farst dying trade which was fast dying. 'But Brummer Striving is a farst dying business, Father,' said young Henry, a young lad. His dad, Harry replied quickly. 'None of thy nonsence, Henry. All thy fathers beforehave and before even that before me were Brummers and that's a fact.' With that he pulled his stumps nearer the fire. 'Tell me again father about how you got those prize stumps was it not with a Brummer Towdry?' said young teenage Henry. 'Why do you always ask about my stumps, Son,' said Harry to Henry with a reasurring. 'Because it's a story I love to hear, Father - and besides it's not every one what has a real cripple for a father.' 'There's something in what you say, I dare say,' said Henry eyeing his son proudly; thinking. 'My son's a Brummer if I ever saw one,' and he had. 'I want to be a golfer, Dad,' said Henry hopefully without a laugh. 'You're a Brummer, Son, so get it straight,' said dad Harry. The next day Henry could not be seen or heard about the quaint little slum and dad Harry was beginning to worry. It's not like him, Mother,' he said to a right old hag who was living with them. 'Blast his hide,' said mother, with an accent. As you might have guessed, teenage young Henry had run around from home and left. 'I'll show that stump,' said Henry to himself, for there was no one with him. Well, it just so happened man that teenage young Henry could not get a golfing job anywhere especially Golfing. 'It seems I'm a born Brummer like dad Harry says I am,' said Harry quietly for no one was listening to him. So he humbled his way homeward like any other teenage Henry would who couldn't get a golfing job. He spotted the slum of his childhood and said out loud 'Crub' which put it in a nutshell. 'Mother, Mother, it's me, teenage young Henry, I'm home,' he said hopeing to be noticed. But hag mother just kept on digging as if she had not noticed him and she hadn't. 'Mother, Mother, it's me' he said repeating himself whilst thinking - 'I wonder what she's digging, it can't be the sounds man.' Still the old wretch kept on digging and also singing to herself – a song you don't often hear now a days. 'Mother, Mother,' said peristant teenage Henry, who was beginning to be a bit of a drag. 'Can't you see I'm burying Soft Harry, your father,' said hag Mother at last. 'All I wanted was a civil answer,' replied Henry assuming responsibility."

Introduction (By Paul McCartney),John Lennon,16450,"{'year': 1964, 'month': None, 'day': None}",In His Own Write,"INTRODUCTION At Woolton village fete I met him. I was a fat schoolboy and, as he leaned an arm on my shoulder, I realised that he was drunk. We were twelve then, but, In spite of his sideboards, we went on to become teenage pals. Aunt Mimi, who had looked after him since he was so high, used to tell me how he was cleverer than he pretended, and things like that. He had written a poem for the school magazine about a hermit who said: “as breathing is my life, to stop I dare not dare”. This made me wonder right away —“Is he deep?”. He wore glasses so it was possible, and even without them there was no holding him. “What ’bus?”, he would say to howls of appreciative laughter. He went to Quarry Bank High School for Boys and later attended to the Liverpool Art College. He left school and played with a group called the Beatles, and, here he is with a book. Again I think —“Is he deep?”. “Is he arty, with it or cultured?”. There are bound to be thickheads who will wonder why some of it doesn’t make sense, and others who will search for hidden meanings. “What’s a Brummer?”. “There’s more to ‘dubb owld boot’ than meets the eye”. “None of it has to make sense and if it seems funny then that’s enough”. Paul P.S. I like the drawings too."

Again Frank looked down at the awful vision which clouded his eyes with fearful weight. “Twelve inches more heavy, Lo!, but am I not more fatty than my brother Geoffery whose father Alec came from Kenneth — through Leslies, who begat Arthur, son of Eric, by the house of Ronald and April —keepers of James of Newcastle who ran Madeline at 2-1 by Silver Flower, (10-2) past Wot-ro-Wot at 4/3d a pound?”. He journeyed downstairs crestfalled and defective —a great wait on his boulders — not even his wife’s battered face could raise a smile on poor Frank’s head —who as you know had no flies on him. His wife, a former beauty queer, regarded him with a strange but burly look. “What ails thee, Frank?”, she asked stretching her prune. “You look dejected if not informal”, she addled. “Tis nothing but wart I have gained but twelve inches more tall heavy than at the very clock of yesterday at this time —am I not the most miserable of men? Suffer ye not to spake to me or I might thrust you a mortal injury; I must traddle this trial alone”. “Lo! Frank —thou hast smote me harshly with such grave talk— am I to blame for this vast burton?”. Frank looked sadly at his wife —forgetting for a moment the cause of his misery. Walking slowly but slowly toward her, he took his head in his hands and with a few swift blows had clubbed her mercifully to the ground dead. “She shouldn’t see me like this”, he mubbled, “not all fat and on her thirty second birthday”. Frank had to get his own breakfast that morning and also on the following mornings. Two, (or was it three?) weeks later Frank awake again to find that there were still no flies on him. “No flies on this Frank boy”, he thought; but to his amazement there seemed to be a lot of flies on his wife —who was still lying about the kitchen floor. “I carn’t not partake of bread and that with her lying about the place”, he thought allowed, writing as he spoke. “I must deliver her to her home where she will be made welcome”. He gathered her in a small sack (for she was only four foot three) and headed for her rightful home. Frank knocked on the door of his wife’s mothers house. She opened the door. “I’ve brought Marian home, Mrs. Sutherskill” (he could never call her Mum). He opened the sack and placed Marian on the doorstep. “I’m not having all those flies in my home”, shouted Mrs. Sutherskill (who was very houseproud), shutting the door. “She could have at least offered me a cup of tea”, thought Frank lifting the problem back on his boulders."

'Goodeven Michael,' the Poleasеman speeg, but Michael did not answer for he was dеbb and duff and could not speeg. 'How's the wive, Michael' spoge the Poleaseman 'Shuttup about that!' 'I thought you were debb and duff and could not speeg,' said the Poleaseman. 'Now what am I going to do with all my debb and duff books?'said Michael, realizing straight away that here was a problem to be reckoned with."

Scene three Act one,John Lennon,16450,"{'year': 1964, 'month': None, 'day': None}",In His Own Write,"(Scene) A broadshouldered room containing hugh fireplace facing a large big windy, a giantsize desk is covered in all type of many business paper and great disorder to look on. There are three or four or five chairs faceing the desk. One are occupied by a scruddy working clog, cap in hook what is gesticulated greatly but humble toward a big fat catipalyst boss. A white man carefully puts coal on the fire and steps back toward a giant door which seems to lead somewhere else. A cat smarting in the corner by the fire leaps up and smiles all on the carpet. A photy of Fieldimarcher Loud Montgammery solving a prodlem looks down on the two men, each of them looking up at it trying to place him. A dog is quietly gnawing at a pigmy under the giant desk. The time is half past three on the old grandbladder clock by the windy. Fatty: 'It's harf parst three Taddpill, and the men haven't done a strike. Why can't we settle this here and now without resorting to a long union discussion and going through all that bit about your father.' Scruddy: 'Why don't yer shut yer gob yer big fat get or I'll kick yer face in. Yer all the same you rich fat Bourgies, workin' uz poor workers to death and getting all the gelt and going to France for yer 'olidays.' Fatty: (going all red and ashen) 'But listen Taddpill you're only working two hours a day now, and three days a week and we're losing money as it is, and here you are complaining again about screw screwing and I'm trying to help you. We could have built our factory somewhere else where men like to work, but Ho no here we are governmentsponsored and all that.' Scruddy: 'Why don't yer shut yer gob yer big fat get or I'll kick yer face in. Yer all the same you rich fat Bourgies, workin' uz poor workers to death and getting all the gelt and going to France for yer 'olidays.' (Enter a coloured woman singing a coloured song, On her back is a great bundle.) Mammy: 'Pope dat barge, left that bail' (She unloads her bundle on the right of the desk.) Fatty: (Impatiently) 'What is it Mammy, can't you see I'm haveing a prodlem with Taddpill and you come in here all black and sing ing? And get that bundle of ruddish away from my big desk!' Mammy: 'O.K. Kimu sahib bwana, massa' (she lifts the bundle and eats it) 'Sho' was naice' Fatty: 'Anyway what was it mammy?' Mammy: 'Dat was yo' little daughter, by yo secind wife KIMU SAHIB' Fatty: (colouring) 'But I'm not married, old Mammy' (Mammy clasps her hands to her head horryfried) 'Oh Lord, I've jes' eaten a bastard!'
(She runs round the room crossing herself, and singing another verse. Scruddy stands up replaceing his cap firmly on his head - walking toward the door he half turns like in the films and shakes his fist.) 'Get this black woman out of this factory before the men find out, or yer'll 'ave a strike on yer fat Bourgie 'ands. I'm tellin yer that for nothin' yer old bum!' (Scruddy walks out of the room leaving Fatty - Mammy and fourteen little Jewish children all singing together a kind of hymn.) THE END"

Derick - and Wimpey. Anyway they all dug about in a diamond mind, which was rich beyond compere. Every day when they came hulme from wirk, they would sing a song - just like ordinary wirkers - the song went something like - 'Yo ho! Yo ho! it's off to wirk we go! ' - which is silly really considerable they were comeing hulme. (Perhaps ther was slight housework to be do.) One day howitzer they (Dwarts) arrived home, at aprodestant, six o'cloth, and who? - who do they find? - but only Snore Wife, asleep in Grumpty's bed. He didn't seem to mine. 'Sambody's been feeding my porrage! ' screams Wimpey, who was ' wearing a light blue pullover. Meanwife in a grand Carstle, not so mile away, a womand is looging in her daily mirror, shouting, 'Mirror mirror on the wall, whom is de fairy in the land.' which doesn't even rhyme. 'Cassandle!' answers the mirror. 'Chrish O'Malley' studders the womand who appears to be a Queen or a witch or an acorn. 'She's talking to that mirror again farther?' says Misst Cradock, 'I've just seen her talking to that mirror again.' Father Cradock turns round slowly from the book he is eating and explains that it is just a face she is going through and they're all the same at that age. 'Well I don't like it one tit,' continhughs Misst Cradock. Father Cradock turns round slowly from the book he is eating, explaining that she doesn't have to like it, and promptly sets fire to his elephant. 'Sick to death of this elephant I am,' he growls, 'sick to death of it eating like an elephant all over the place.' Suddenly bark at the Several Dwarts home, Snore Wife has became a firm favourite, especially with her helping arm, brushing away the little droppings. 'Good old Snore Wife! ' thee all sage, 'Good old Snore Wife is our fave rave.' 'And I like you tooth! ' rejoices Snore Wife, 'I like you all my little dwarts.' Without warping they hear a soddy voice continuallykhan shoubing and screeging about apples for sale. 'New apples for old! ' says the above hearing voice. 'Try these nice apples for chrissake!' Grumpy turnips quick and answers shooting - 'Why?' and they all look at him. A few daisy lately the same voice comes hooting aboon the apples for sale with a rarther more firm aproach saying 'These apples are definitely for sale.' Snore Wife, who by this time is curiously aroused, stick her heads through the window. Anyway she bought one - which didn't help the trade gap at all. Little diggerydoo that it was parsened with deathly arsenickers. The woman (who was the wickered Queen in disgust) cackled away to her carstle in the hills larfing fit to bust. Anyway the handsome Prince who was really Misst Cradock, found out and promptly ate the Wicked Queen and smashed up the mirror. After he had done this he journeyed to the house of the Several Dwarts and began to live with them. He refused to marry Snore Wife on account of his health, what with her being poissoned and that, but they came to an agreement much to the disgust of Sleepy - Grumpty - Sneeky - Dog - Smirkey - Alice? - Derick and Wimpy. The Dwarts clubbed together and didn't buy a new mirror, but always sang a happy song. They all livered happily ever aretor until they died - which somebody of them did naturally enough."

I cried and called him Ronnie He didn’t seem to care Although his name was Arthur It didn’t mean a thing. He went into a petshop And ate up everything. The doctors looked inside him, To see what they could do, But he had been too greedy He died just like a zoo.
My Jeffrey chirps and twitters When I walk into a room, I make him scrambled egg on toast And feed him with a spoon. He sings like other budgies But only when in trim But most of all on Sunday That’s when I plug him in. He flies about the room sometimes And sits upon my bed And if he’s really happy He does it on my head. He’s on a diet now you know From eating far too much They say if he gets fatter He’ll have to wear a crutch. It would be funny wouldn’t it A budgie on a stick Imagine all the people Laughing till they’re sick.

Anyway he carried on as Norman for why should he worried? All of suddy he heard a small little voice calling him by name, “Eric… Eric Hearble”, it seemed to say though I couldn’t say for sure. That night the very same voice spoke saying “Eric, I am a growth on your very head, help me, Eric”. Soon Eric became very attached to his fat growth friend. “Call me Scab”, the voice said and he was. “Call me Eric”, Eric said naturly as he could. From then on you never saw Eric without the big fat scab growth on his head. And that’s why Eric Hearble lost his job teaching spastics to dance. “Were not having a cripple teaching our lads”, said Headmaster."

The Maharishi Song,John Lennon,16450,"{'year': 1968, 'month': 1, 'day': 1}",,"Well let me tell you something About the Maharishi camp In Rishikesh There were one or two attractive women there But mainly looked like, you know Schoolteachers or something And the whole damn camp Was spying on the ones in the bathing suits And they're supposed to be meditating And there's this cowboy there called Tom Who plays cowboys on TV And my, did the Beatle wives go for him in a big way I wondered what it was - It was his tight leather belt His jeans, and his dumb eyes They seemed to love them eyes (What's wrong with his eye? You have big eyes.) Me, I took it for real I wrote six hundred songs about how I feel I felt like dying, and crying, and committing suicide But I felt creative and said: ""What the hell's this got to do with What that silly little man's talking about?""
But he did charm me in a way Because he was funny, sort of cuddly Like a sort of, you know (Like a teddy bear) Little daddy with a beard Telling stories of heaven As if he knew You could never pin him down But he often spread rumors through his right hand man Who used to be with the CIA And told about the planes he saved How Maharishi came through the storm on a plane And the pilot was getting worried they couldn't land When Maharishi looked up And with one foul look (According to the man who works for him) Everything was OK and they landed After that I thought: lies But who was that woman that looks like Jean Simmons That keeps going to him for private interviews? She must have been about forty, forty-five Kept telling about her husband cause he wasn't there He was always trying to get a private audience with the Maharishi And he kept refusing
I knew only one thing: He must have had some of his own It must have been that little Indian piece She came with the tailor And could sit at his feet And that was one in five hundred The rest had to wait like good American people In lines to see the master walking on the petals Who lived in a million dollar staccato house overlooking the Himalayas He looked holy (But he was a sex maniac) I couldn't say that, but he certainly wasn't... (Holy) In the true sense of the word, that is"

The Singularge Experience of Miss Anne Duffield,John Lennon,16450,,A Spaniard in the Works,"I find it recornered in my nosebook that it was a dokey and winnie cave towart the end of Marge in the ear of our Loaf 1892 in Much Bladder, a city off the North Wold. Shamrock Womlbs had receeded a telephart whilst we sat at our lunch eating. He made no remark but the matter ran down his head, for he stud in front of the fire with a thoughtfowl face, smirking his pile, and casting an occasional gland at the massage. Quite sydney without warping he turd upod me with a miscarriage twinkle in his isle. “Ellifitzgerrald my dear Whopper,” he grimmond then sharply “Guess whom has broken out of jail Whopper?” My mind immediately recoughed all the caramels that had recently escaped or escaped from Wormy Scabs. “Eric Morley,” I ventured. He shook his bed. “Oxo Whitney,” I queered, he knotted in the infirmary. “Rygo Hargraves?” I winston agreably. “No, my dear Whopper, it's OXO WHITNEY” he bellowed as if I was in another room, and I wasn't. “How d'you know Womlbs,” I whispered excretely. “Harrybellafonte, my dear Whopper.” At that precise morman a tall rather angularce tall thin man knocked on the door “By all accounts that must be he, Whopper.” I marvelled at his acute osbert lancaster. “How on urge do you know Womlbs” I asped, revealing my bad armchair. “Eliphantitus my deaf Whopper” he baggage knocking out his pip on his large leather leg. In warped the favourite Oxo Whimey none the worse for worms. “I'm an escaped primrose Mr Womlbs” he grate darting francfically about the room. “Calm down Mr Whitney!” I interpolled “or you'll have a nervous breadvan.” “You must be Doctored Whopper” he pharted. My friend was starving at Whitney with a strange hook on his eager face, that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostriches and constapation of the heavy tufted brows which I knew so well. “Gorra ciggie Oxo” said Womlbs quickly. I looked at my colledge, hoping for some clue as to the reason for this sodden outboard, he gave me no sign except a slight movement of his good leg as he kicked Oxo Whitney to the floor. “Gorra ciggie Oxo” he reapeted almouth hysterically. “What on urn are you doing my dear Womlbs” I imply; “nay I besiege you, stop lest you do this poor wretch an injury!”
“Shut yer face yer blubbering owld get” screamed Womlbs like a man fermented, and laid into Mr Whitney something powerful net. This wasn't not the Shamrock Womlbs I used to nose, I thought puzzled and hearn at this suddy change in my old friend. Mary Atkins pruned herselves in the mirrage, running her hand wantanly through her large blond hair. Her tight dress was cut low revealingly three or four blackheads, carefully scrubbed on her chess. She addled the final touches to her makeup and fixed her teeth firmly in her head. “He's going to want me tonight” she thought and pictured his hamsome black curly face and jaundice. She looked at her clocks impatiently and went to the window, then leapt into her favorite armchurch, picking up the paper she glassed at the headlines. “MORE NEGOES IN THE CONGO” it read, and there was, but it was the Stop Press which corked her eye. “JACK THE NIPPLE STRIKE AGAIN.” She went cold all over, it was Sydnees and he'd left the door open. “Hello lover” he said slapping her on the butter. “Oh you did give me a start Sydnees” she shrieked laughing arf arfily. “I always do my love” he replied jumping on all fours. She joined him and they galloffed quickly downstairs into a her, rased cab. “Follow that calf” yelped Sydnees pointing a rude fingure. “White hole mate!” said the scabbie. “Why are we bellowing that card Sydnees?” inquired Mary fashionably. “He might know where the party” explained Sydnees. “Oh I see” said Mary looking up at him as if to say. The journey parssed pleasantly enough with Sydnees and Mary pointing out places of interest to the scab driver; such as Buckinghell Parcel, the Horses of Parliamint, the Chasing of the Guards. One place of particularge interest was the Statue of Eric in Picanniny Surplass. “They say that if you stand there long enough you'll meet a friend” said Sydnees knowingly, “that's if your not run over.” “God Save the Queens” shouted the scabbie as they passed the Parcel for maybe the fourth time. “Jack the Nipple” said Womlbs puffing deeply on his wife, “is not only a vicious murderer but a sex meany of the lowest orgy.” Then my steamed collie relit his pig and walkered to the windy of his famous flat in Bugger St in London where it all happened. I pondled on his statemouth for a mormon then turding sharply I said. “But how do you know Womlbs?”
“Alibabba my dead Whopper, I have seen the film.” I knew him toby right for I had only read the comic. That evenig we had an unexpeckled visitor, Inspectre Basil, I knew him by his tell-tale unicorn. “Ah Inspectre Basil mon cher amie” said Womlbs spotting him at once. “What brings you to our humble rich establisment?” “I come on behave of thousands” the Inspectre said sitting quietly on his operation. “I feel I know why you are here Basil” said Womlbs eyeing he leg. “It's about Jock the Cripple is it not?” The Inspectre smiled smiling. “How did you guess?” I inquired all puzzle. “Alecguiness my deep Whopper, the mud on the Inspectre's left, and also the buttock on his waistbox is misting.” The Inspectre looked astoundagast and fidgeted nervously from one fat to the other. “You neville sieze to amass me Mr Wolmbs.” “A drink genitalmen” I veneured, “before we get down to the businose in hand in hand?” They both knotted in egremont and I went to the cocky cabinet. “What would you prepare Basil, Bordom '83 or?” “I'd rather have rather have rather” said the Inspectre who was a gourmless. After a drink and a few sam leeches Womlbs got up and paced the Boor up and down up and down pacing. “Why are you pacing the floor up and down up and down pacing dear Womlbs” I inquiet. “I'm thinking alowed my deaf Whopper.” I looked over at the Inspectre and knew that he couldn't hear him either. “Guess who's out of jail Mr Womlbs” the Inspectre said subbenly. Womlbs looked at me knowingly.
“Eric Morley,” I asked, they shook their heaths. “Oxo Whitney?” I quart, again they shoot their heaps. “Rygo Hargraves?” I wimpied. “No my dear Whopper, OXO WHITNEY!” shouted Wornlbs leaping to his foot. I looked at him admiring this great man all the morphia. Meanwire in a ghasly lit street in Chelthea, a darkly clocked man with a fearful weapon, creeped about serging for revenge on the women of the streets for giving him the dreadfoot V.D. (Valentine Dyall). “I'll kill them all womb by womb” he mufflst between scenes. He was like a black shadow or negro on that dumb foggy night as he furtively looked for his neck victim. His minds wandered back to his childhook, remembering a vague thing or two like his mother and farmer and how they had beaten him for eating his sister. “I'm demented” he said checking his dictionary, “I should bean at home on a knife like these.” He turned into a dim darky and spotted a light. Mary Atkins pruned herselves in the mirrage running her hand wantanly through her large blond hair. Her tight dress was cut low revealingly three or four more blackheads carefully scrubbed on her chess. Business had been bad lately and what with the cost of limping. She hurriedly tucked in her gooseberries and opened the door. “No wonder business is bad” she remarked as she caught size of her hump in the hall mirror. “My warts are showing.” With a carefree yodel she slept into the street and caught a cab to her happy humping grounds. “That Sydnees's nothing but a pimple living on me thus” she thought “lazing about day in day off, and here's me plowing my train up and down like Sofi Arthur and you know how soft Arthur.” She got off as uterus at Nats Café and took up her position. “They'll never even see me in this fog” she muttered switching on her lamps. Just then a blasted Policemat walked by. “Blasted Policemat” she shouted, but luckily he was dea£ “Blasted deaf Policemat” she shouted. “Why don't yer gerra job!” Little did she gnome that the infamous Jack the Nipple was only a few street away. “I hope that blasted Jack the Nipple isn't only a few streets away,” she said, “he's not right in the heads.” “How much lady” a voice shocked her from the toorways of Nats. Lucky for him there was a sale on so they soon retched an agreement. A very high class genderman she thought as they walked quickly together down the now famous Carringto Average. “I tell yer she whore a good woman Mr Womlbs sir” said Sydnees Aspinall. “I quite believe you Mr Asterpoll, after all you knew her better than me and dear old buddy friend Whopper, but wc are not here to discuss her merits ge,od or otherwives, we arc here, Mr Asronaute, to discover as much information as wc can about the unfortunate and untidy death of Mary Atkins.” Womlbs looked the man in the face effortlessly. “The name's Aspinall guvnor” said the wretched man. “I'm deleware of your name Mr Astracan.” Womlbs said looking as if he was going to smash him. “Well as long as you know,” said Aspinall wishing he'd gone to Safely Safely Sunday Trip. Womlbs took down the entrails from Aspinall as quickly as he could, I could see that they weren't on the same waveleg. “The thing the: puddles me Womlbs,” I said when we were alone, “is what happened to Oxo Whitney,” Womlbs logged at me intently, I could see that great mind was thinking as his tufed eyepencil knit toboggen, his strong jew jutted out, his nosepack flared, and the limes on his fourheads wrinkled. “That's a question Whopper.” he said and I marveled at his grammer. Next day Womlbs was up at the crack of dorchesrer, he didn't evening look at the moaning papers. As yewtree I fixed his breakfat of bogard, a gottle of geer, a slice of jewish bread, three eggs with little liars on, two rashes of bacon, a bowd of Rice Kr u stchovs, a fresh grapeful , mu shr u de s, so me freed tomorrows, a basket of fruits, and a cup of teens. “Breakfeet are ready” I showbody “It's on the table.” But to my supplies he'd already gone. “Blast the wicker basket yer grannie sleeps in.” I thought “Only kidding Shamrock” I said remembering his habit of hiding in the cupboard. That day was an anxious one for me as I waited for news of my dear friend, I kcame fretful and couldn't finish my Kennomeat, it wasn't like Shamrock to leave me here all by my own, lonely; without him I was at large. I rang up a few close itamate friends but they didn't know either, even Inspectre Basil didn't know, and if anybody should know, Inspectre Basil should 'cause he's a Police. I was a week lately when I saw him again and I was shocked by his apeerless, he was a tishovelled rock. “My God Womlbs” I cried “My Got, what on earth have you been?” “All in good time Whopper” he trousered. “Wait till I get my breast back.” I poked the fire and warmed his kippers, when he had minicoopered he told me a story which to this day I can't remember."

'Why but why do they say these bad things about me when I have but never halmed or speak bad,' he would say, but I never heard him. 'He's drawing bad Christians on the graves,' Mrs Weatherby would spread. The whole village was alarming. 'We can't have all this,' said the Vicar, who was a Christian.
